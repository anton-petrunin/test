 1. Pirat's democracy --- 5 pirats have 100 gold coins. They decided to divide it in a democratic way.
 The oldest one can propose a way to divide the money and after that the rest of pirats wote, if the majority votes in in its favor or votes split equally, then they accept the proposed way; othervise the propeser is kiked in the ocian. Each of them smart and greedy, they vote only if it is ... and vote agains if .... otherwise do not bother to vote.
 What is the maximal amout which the oldest pirat can leave for him self?
